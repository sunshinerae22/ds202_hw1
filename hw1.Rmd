Write a paragraph (<100 words) describing a job that you think is related to data science. Write your paragraph in R Markdown in a nice format to read. Include at least 
    a. a link 
    b. an image
    c. an italized and a bolded word.

Here is a link that talks about that: <https://www.discoverdatascience.org/industries/law-enforcement/> . ![](https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/pauley-perrette-ncis-leaving.jpg?w=620)
